StonkFace Deployment Verification
==================================

This file confirms the correct build output is being deployed.

Build Date: 2024-12-01
Source: stonk-face/public/DEPLOYED.txt
Expected Output Directory: dist/client/

If you can see this file at https://your-site.pages.dev/DEPLOYED.txt
then the public directory is being copied correctly.

If you see "hello world" instead of the StonkFace app:
1. Check Cloudflare Pages build settings
2. Verify "Build output directory" is set to: dist/client
3. Verify "Build command" is: npm run build:client
4. Check the build logs for any errors

Expected files in dist/client/:
- index.html (React app entry point)
- assets/ (JavaScript and CSS bundles)
- DEPLOYED.txt (this file)
- _redirects (SPA routing configuration)
