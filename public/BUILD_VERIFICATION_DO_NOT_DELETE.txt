  STONKFACE BUILD VERIFICATION FILE
================================================================================

If you can see this file, your Cloudflare Pages build is configured correctly!

Date Created: December 1, 2024
Source Location: stonk-face/public/BUILD_VERIFICATION_DO_NOT_DELETE.txt
Expected Deploy Location: dist/client/BUILD_VERIFICATION_DO_NOT_DELETE.txt

This file should be accessible at:
https://your-site.pages.dev/BUILD_VERIFICATION_DO_NOT_DELETE.txt

================================================================================
  CONFIGURATION CHECK
================================================================================

✅ Build Command: npm run build:client
✅ Build Output Directory: dist/client
✅ Root Directory: (empty)
✅ Framework: Vite
✅ Node Version: 18

================================================================================
  IF YOU SEE "HELLO WORLD" INSTEAD OF STONKFACE APP
================================================================================

This means ONE of the following:

1. WRONG BUILD OUTPUT DIRECTORY
   - Check Cloudflare Pages Settings > Builds & deployments
   - Build output directory MUST be exactly: dist/client
   - NOT "dist" or "client" or "/dist/client" or "build"

2. MULTIPLE CLOUDFLARE PAGES PROJECTS
   - You might have 2+ Pages projects
   - One is correct, one is showing "hello world"
   - Check which project you're viewing
   - Delete old/test projects

3. WRONG PROJECT URL
   - You might be viewing a different project's URL
   - Check the URL matches your actual deployment

4. CACHED OLD VERSION
   - Browser cached old deployment
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or try incognito/private mode

5. BUILD OUTPUT DIRECTORY HAS WRONG CASE
   - Linux/Unix are case-sensitive
   - Must be "dist/client" not "Dist/Client" or "DIST/CLIENT"

================================================================================
  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
================================================================================

RIGHT NOW, do these steps in order:

STEP 1: Verify you can see THIS file
   Visit: https://your-site.pages.dev/BUILD_VERIFICATION_DO_NOT_DELETE.txt

   ✅ Can see this file? → Configuration is CORRECT, proceed to Step 2
   ❌ Cannot see this file? → Build output directory is WRONG, fix it first

STEP 2: If you CAN see this file but homepage shows "hello world"
   Then the build is correct but something else is wrong:

   A. Check browser console (F12)
      - Look for JavaScript errors (red text)
      - Look for failed network requests

   B. View page source (Right-click > View Page Source)
      - Should see: <!-- StonkFace v1.0 - Deployed from client/index.html -->
      - If you see "hello world" in source, wrong project is deployed

   C. Check you're on the right domain
      - Cloudflare gives you: yourproject.pages.dev
      - Make sure you're not on a different Pages project

STEP 3: Check test page
   Visit: https://your-site.pages.dev/test.html
   Should show a purple gradient page with "StonkFace is HERE!"

================================================================================
  NUCLEAR OPTION - START FRESH
================================================================================

If nothing above works:

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard:
   - Pages > Your Project > Settings
   - Scroll to bottom
   - "Delete project"

2. Create new Pages project:
   - Connect to GitHub: jak-straw/stonk-face
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build command: npm run build:client
   - Build output: dist/client
   - Add environment variable: NODE_VERSION = 18
   - Deploy

3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build

4. Check this file again at new URL

================================================================================
  CONTACT INFO
================================================================================

If you've tried EVERYTHING and still see "hello world":

1. Take screenshots of:
   - Cloudflare build settings page
   - Cloudflare build logs
   - The "hello world" page
   - Browser console errors (F12)

2. Check GitHub repo has latest commits:
   - Should see commits about "Cloudflare deployment"
   - Should see this BUILD_VERIFICATION file in repo

3. Verify build succeeded in Cloudflare:
   - Check deployment status is "Success" not "Failed"
   - Check build logs show "✓ built in ~2s"

================================================================================
  EXPECTED WORKING STATE
================================================================================

When everything works correctly:

Homepage (/)
   - Shows: StonkFace header with "Share Your Favorite Videos" subtitle
   - Has: Dark/light mode toggle in top right
   - Contains: Video upload form on left
   - Contains: Video player area on right
   - Working: Add video functionality with localStorage

Test Page (/test.html)
   - Shows: Purple gradient page
   - Says: "StonkFace is HERE!"

This File (/BUILD_VERIFICATION_DO_NOT_DELETE.txt)
   - Shows: This text you're reading now

================================================================================

Good luck! The app is ready, the build works - it's just a configuration issue.
